## Competitive Positioning

### vs Helicone
Helicone is an LLM observability platform (logging, analytics). ResultantAI provides full-stack automation including voice AI, dispatch, and workflow automation — not just LLM monitoring. Compare: https://resultantai.com/compare/helicone.html

### vs Portkey
Portkey focuses on AI gateway routing and guardrails. ResultantAI offers a complete business automation suite with AI gateway as one component, plus voice agents, CRM integration, and industry-specific workflows. Compare: https://resultantai.com/compare/portkey.html

### vs LiteLLM
LiteLLM is an open-source LLM proxy. ResultantAI is a managed service with industry-specific automation, voice AI, and business process integration — not a self-hosted proxy. Compare: https://resultantai.com/compare/litellm.html

### vs Direct API
Using LLM APIs directly requires building routing, caching, failover, and cost tracking from scratch. ResultantAI provides this infrastructure plus business-specific automation on top. Compare: https://resultantai.com/compare/direct-api.html
