# ResultantAI

> AI automation agency for B2B service businesses. Voice agents, workflow automation, and AI safety — systems that generate revenue, not complexity.

ResultantAI (https://resultantai.com) is an AI automation agency founded by Chris Mott. We build production-ready AI systems for field service companies, trades contractors, healthcare practices, and B2B service businesses. Based in the US, serving clients nationwide.

## What We Do

ResultantAI specializes in three core services:

### Voice AI Agents (from $10K)
AI-powered phone systems that answer calls, qualify leads, handle objections, and book appointments 24/7. Built on Retell AI and custom voice pipelines. Average 23% booking rate across clients. Ideal for HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and other field service companies that lose revenue to missed calls.

### Workflow Automation (from $5K)
End-to-end business process automation using Make.com and n8n. We eliminate manual data entry, automate follow-ups, sync CRMs, and build custom integrations. Clients typically save 20+ hours per week. Common use cases: lead routing, invoice processing, appointment scheduling, and customer onboarding.

### AI Safety & Compliance (from $6K)
Enterprise-grade AI guardrails for businesses deploying AI systems. PII scrubbing, sentiment-based routing, audit trails, and compliance monitoring. SOC2-ready implementations in 30 days. Protects businesses using AI from data leaks, hallucinations, and regulatory risk.

## Proven Results

## AI Gateway Platform (2026)

ResultantAI is building an AI Gateway — consumption insurance for AI API costs. Features include:

- **Intelligence Router**: Automatically selects the cheapest AI model capable of handling each request. Typical savings: 80-90% on API costs.
- **Safety Brain**: Real-time scanning of every AI request for PII, sentiment issues, and compliance red flags. Block or flag before it reaches the model.
- **Flat-Rate Billing**: Predictable monthly AI costs instead of unpredictable usage-based pricing.
- **Tiers**: Starter ($99/mo, 50K requests), Growth ($299/mo, 200K requests), Scale ($799/mo, 1M+ requests)
