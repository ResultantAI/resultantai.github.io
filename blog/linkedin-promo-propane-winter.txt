**LinkedIn Post for Tomorrow (Polar Vortex Timing)**

---

As the polar vortex blankets half the country in sub-zero temperatures, propane dealers are entering their most profitable—and most chaotic—week of the year.

Demand surges 300%. Phones ring off the hook. Drivers work 12-hour days.

And in the scramble to keep tanks filled, most operations are bleeding money they'll never recover.

---

The $75 emergency that nobody remembers to bill:

It's 3 PM Saturday. Emergency call—family's tank ran out, -15°F tonight.

You inject a rush delivery into Mike's route:
• 180 gallons × $2.85 = $513
• Out-of-gas surcharge: $75
• Same-day rush: $45
• Saturday: $35

**Should bill: $668**
**Actually billed: $513**

$155 gone. Mike was focused on the delivery. Dispatcher was juggling six other emergencies. Nobody checked the surcharge boxes.

---

**Multiply this across a winter season:**

• 720 deliveries per truck
• 12% miss surcharges (industry avg)
• $75 average missed fee

**= $6,450 per truck**
**8 trucks = $51,600**

Add after-hours ($50), long pulls ($25), difficult access ($35)?

**The real number: $64,000 annually.**

---

But it's not just surcharges.

**The 15-minute leak check you're skipping:**

NFPA 54 requires leak checks before refilling empty tanks.

When you're 12 stops behind and temps are lethal, that test feels like torture.

Some drivers skip it. Some do a "quick test" without documenting.

Either way, you're exposed:
• Liability if there's a leak
• Insurance claims denied for non-compliance
• $75 billable service lost

One GM told me: "Driver filled an out-of-gas tank without testing. Rusty fitting. House filled with propane. Thank God nobody lit a match. Insurance fought us for 18 months because we couldn't prove the test was done."

---

**The dispatch puzzle that eats 2.4 hours/day:**

Emergency calls inject into pre-planned routes.
Road closures force reroutes.
Drivers call: "I've got 400 gallons left, where next?"

Your dispatcher is juggling this on a whiteboard.

2.4 hours × 90 winter days = 216 hours
At $28/hour: **$6,048 in unnecessary labor**

That doesn't include routing inefficiencies—drivers passing customers who needed delivery tomorrow anyway.

---

**The 4-day invoicing backlog killing cash flow:**

Normal weeks: Same-day invoicing, paid in 30 days
Winter surge: 4-day backlog, paid in 34+ days

$120K in Mon-Thu deliveries delayed 4 days = **$16K tied up in float**

For tight-margin seasonal businesses, that matters.

---

**The paradox:**

Winter emergencies are both your biggest revenue opportunity AND your biggest operational leak.

The dealers who thrive during surge aren't working harder.

They've built systems that don't break under surge load:

✅ **Mandatory surcharge capture** (not memory-based)
✅ **Safety interlocks** (can't deliver to out-of-gas without leak check)
✅ **Drag-and-drop dispatch** (30 seconds vs 15 minutes)
✅ **Same-day QuickBooks sync** (no manual entry)

---

The polar vortex will pass. Demand will normalize.

But if you're still losing $64K/year to forgotten surcharges, burning 2+ hours/day on manual dispatch, and invoicing 4 days late—

**Next winter will look exactly the same.**

---

I built an interactive demo showing how these systems work during a winter surge scenario:

• Live dispatch with drag-and-drop optimization
• Driver app with mandatory surcharge capture
• NFPA 54 leak check interlocks
• Same-day invoicing automation
• ROI calculator (estimate your surcharge leak)

Link in comments. No signup required. 5 minutes.

The operations that win long-term aren't working hardest during the surge.

They're the ones who built systems that don't break when the phones won't stop ringing.

---

**Alternative shorter version (if you want punchier):**

---

The polar vortex is here.

Propane dealers are facing 300% demand surge, 12-hour driver shifts, and phones ringing off the hook.

Most will also lose $64,000 this winter.

Not from the storm. From forgotten surcharges.

---

Emergency delivery at 3 PM Saturday:
• Family ran out of propane
• -15°F forecast tonight
• Should bill: $668 (delivery + 3 surcharges)
• Actually billed: $513

$155 gone. Nobody remembered to check the boxes.

720 deliveries × 12% miss rate = **$6,450 per truck per season**

8 trucks = **$51,600**

Add after-hours fees, long pulls, difficult access?
**Real number: $64,000 annually.**

---

It's not just money.

**That 15-minute NFPA 54 leak check on out-of-gas tanks?**

When you're 12 stops behind, drivers skip it.

One GM: "Driver filled an empty tank without testing. Rusty fitting leaked. House filled with propane. Thank God nobody lit a match. Insurance fought us 18 months because we couldn't prove the test was done."

---

**The dispatch chaos eating 2.4 hours/day:**

Emergency injections. Road closures. "I've got 400 gallons left, where next?"

Whiteboard juggling: 216 hours over winter = **$6K in dispatcher labor**

**The 4-day invoicing backlog:**

$120K in deliveries delayed = **$16K tied up in float**

---

The dealers who thrive during winter surge built systems that don't break:

✅ Mandatory surcharge capture
✅ Leak check safety interlocks
✅ 30-second dispatch reassignment
✅ Same-day QuickBooks sync

I built an interactive demo showing these systems during a simulated polar vortex.

Link in comments. Takes 5 minutes. Includes ROI calculator.

The polar vortex will pass.

But if you're still losing $64K/year, next winter looks the same.

Build systems that work when chaos hits.
