## Tips for Screenshots:

1. **Dark theme preferred** - matches site aesthetic
2. **Anonymize sensitive data** - blur/redact client info, phone numbers, addresses
3. **High quality** - crisp text, clear UI elements
4. **Brand consistency** - if using mockups, use emerald accent (#10b981)
5. **Mobile-friendly** - images will be viewed on phones, keep text readable

## Alternative if Screenshots Not Available:

If actual system screenshots can't be shared (client confidentiality), consider:
1. **Mockup creation** - clean mockups using Figma/Sketch
2. **Annotated diagrams** - workflow diagrams showing system architecture
3. **Generic placeholders** - professional dark-themed placeholder graphics
4. **Leave as gradient backgrounds** - current placeholders look clean

Current placeholder gradients are production-ready if screenshots aren't available.
